# Introduction to Computer Science 161/162
I completed two terms of the introductory CS course at Oregon State 
in during the winter and fall terms of 2017. Taught by Professor Jennifer
Parham Mocello, these classes focused on object-oriented programming
in C++. I was given two weeks to design and implement each project. 
Each line of code wasd written by me; I was not given any starter code. 
Each assignment had a list of specific requirements and took around 20 hours
to complete. I learned the following skills: use of pointers (passing by value
and reference), data structures such as dynamic arrays and linked lists, recursion, 
classes, inheritance and polymorphism, file I/O, and more.
